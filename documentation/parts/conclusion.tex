\section{Conclusion \& Outlook}
At lot of time has been spent to understand the used technologies as deeply as possible by all developers which resulted in multiply branches working on the same working categories at the same time resulting in a overhead when the initial merges had to be made. Once a core has been established the addition of features and general speed of development increased to an acceptable leve since every developer is now able to understand how the technology stack works and can contribute not just on a conceptional base but also in a technical discussion.
However, our conceptional idea of a module based chat application where features could easily be added similar to a plugin approach was not successful. Feature implementation does however work smoothly now. Since we used react a component driven feature addition for the frontend is our goal for the future. Developers should be able to independently develop components which then only have to be referenced at the wanted location.
